# LAION-Face
![](example.png)

## Introduction
LAION-Face is the human face subset of [LAION-400M](https://laion.ai/laion-400-open-dataset/), it consists of 50 million image-text pairs. Face detection is conducted to find images with faces. Apart from the 50 million full-set(LAION-Face 50M), we also provide a 20 million sub-set(LAION-Face 20M) for fast evaluation. 

LAION-Face is first used as the training set of [FaRL](https://github.com/FacePerceiver/FaRL), which provides powerful pre-training transformer backbones for face analysis tasks.

*For now, we only provide the image id list of those contains human face, you need download the images by yourself following the instructions below. We will further provide the face detection metadata.*

## Setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We need `pyarrow` to read and write parque file, `img2dataset` to download images.

## Download the metadata

We provide the list of sample_id in [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FacePerceiver/laion-face/resolve/main/laion_face_ids.pth).

Download and convert the metadata with the following commands. 

```bash
wget -l1 -r --no-parent https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion400m-met-release/laion400m-meta/
mv the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion400m-met-release/laion400m-meta/ .
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/FacePerceiver/laion-face/resolve/main/laion_face_ids.pth
python convert_parquet.py ./laion_face_ids.pth ./laion400m-meta ./laion_face_meta
```

## Download the images with img2dataset
When metadata is ready, you can start download the images.

```bash
bash download.sh ./laion_face_meta ./laion_face_data
```

Please be patient, this command might run over days, and cost about 2T disk space, and it will download 50 million image-text pairs as 32 parts.

- To use the **LAION-Face 50M**, you should use all the 32 parts.
- To use the **LAION-Face 20M**, you should use these parts.
    ```
    0,2,5,8,13,15,17,18,21,22,24,25,28
    ```

checkout `download.sh` and [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) for more details and parameter setting.

## Download the Face Detection Metata 

We use [batch-face](https://github.com/elliottzheng/batch-face) to detect faces on the images, here we provide the face detection result of each sample.

To download the detection result, use the following command.
```bash
bash download_detection.sh ./detection_metadata
```
it will download 32 `sample2detect.pth` to the `detection_metadata`, cost about 30G disk space, each corresponding to a part as in last section.

Each pth is a dict object, it's key is int(SAMPLE_ID), and the value is the face detection result.

To get the face detection result of single image, you can refer to the code snippet below.

```python
import torch
part_index=0
SAMPLE_ID=int(SAMPLE_ID) # you can get it from the parquet file generated by the img2dataset 
sample2detect=torch.load(f"detection_metadata/sample2detect_{part_index}.pth") # each part has a sample2detect pth, its a dict
faces=sample2detect[SAMPLE_ID]
box, landmarks, score = faces[0] # face rectangle, the standard five points, confidence

```
## License
LAION-Face is the face subset of [LAION-400M](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset), we distribute the image id list (the pth files) under the most open Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license, which poses no particular restriction. The metadata of the dataset are from [LAION-400M](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset). Please check [LAION-400M](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-400-open-dataset) for more details.
